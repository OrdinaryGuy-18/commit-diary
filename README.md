# commit-diary

This is my personal commit diary — a daily log of code, thoughts, and experiments.  
I use this repo to stay consistent, reflect on my growth, and keep my GitHub streak alive.

## What's inside

- `logs/` → Daily markdown entries: what I worked on, learned, or struggled with.
- `snippets/` → Small code pieces I tested or explored.
- `experiments/` → Drafts and mini-projects that may evolve later.
- `ideas/` → Notes, plans, and random dev thoughts.

## Why this repo?

Because growth isn't just about big releases — it's about showing up daily.  
This diary is my way of tracking effort-before-escape, one commit at a time.
